Forever since, through SRiSHTi, IEEE Students Chapter 12951 has been on a spectacular trek forward, inculcating scientific temper and innovative thinking among the young minds of India. In this relatively short, yet heavily impactful run, SRiSHTi has garnered fruitful participation from over 100 colleges spanning the length and breadth of India and has been influential in helping technological innovation flourish among the youth populace.<span id ="dots">...</span><span id ="more" style="display:none;"> SRiSHTi is one of the biggest technical festivals in the country and showcases the talent of students from various colleges across the nation. It is acclaimed for the diverse experiences and opportunities it offers for technology enthusiasts. In SRiSHTi, around 25 events are grouped under 6 broad clusters, each cluster dealing with different realms of science and technology.The fest hosts a variety of Events, Workshops, Exhibitions, Hackathons, Guest Lectures, Infotainment shows and many more. One thing that differentiates SRiSHTi from other technical fests of its kind is that online participation is encouraged as much as offline participation. </span>
